me: Can you help me split my code into functions?
AI: Absolutely! Splitting your code into functionsâ€”also called modularisationâ€”is a core requirement of your Weather Advisor project. It makes your code easier to read, test, and debug.

Hereâ€™s how you can break your code into logical, reusable functions, aligned with your assignment requirements.

ðŸ§© Required Core Functions
You're expected to define and use these functions:

1. get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5)
Purpose: Fetch current and forecast weather for a given location.

Inputs: Location (string), forecast_days (default 5)

Returns: A dictionary containing weather data

python
Copy
Edit
def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5):
    # API request here using requests
    # Process and return the weather JSON as a dictionary
    pass
2. parse_weather_question(question)
Purpose: Take a natural language question and extract key parts (location, date, attribute).

Returns: A dictionary like:

python
Copy
Edit
{
    "location": "Melbourne",
    "date": "tomorrow",
    "attribute": "temperature"
}
3. generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data)
Purpose: Given a parsed question and data, return a natural-language answer.

Returns: String response to user

4. create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data, output_type='display')
Purpose: Plot temperature trends from weather data using matplotlib or seaborn.

5. create_precipitation_visualisation(weather_data, output_type='display')
Purpose: Plot precipitation probabilities or rainfall amounts.

6. main_menu() (optional for console UI)
Purpose: Show a user-friendly menu using pyinputplus or plain input()

Calls other functions based on user selections.

âœ… Example of How to Use Them Together
python
Copy
Edit
def main():
    print("Welcome to the Weather Advisor!")
    user_question = input("Ask a weather-related question: ")

    parsed = parse_weather_question(user_question)
    data = get_weather_data(parsed["location"])
    response = generate_weather_response(parsed, data)

    print(response)

    # Optional visualisations
    create_temperature_visualisation(data)
    create_precipitation_visualisation(data)

If you share your current code with me, Iâ€™ll help you split it into these functions directly. I can also:

Suggest improvements

Add proper docstrings

Clean up duplicated logic
