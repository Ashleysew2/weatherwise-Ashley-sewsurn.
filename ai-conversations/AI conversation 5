Me: My code gives an error ‚Äî can you help me fix it?
AI: I'd be happy to help fix the error in your code! Please do one of the following:

Paste the error message you're getting, along with the relevant section of your code, or

Upload your .ipynb or .py file if you're working in Google Colab or a Python IDE.

Once I see the error and code, I‚Äôll explain what‚Äôs going wrong and how to fix it.
ME: ‚ùå Error: Unable to fetch data for 'Atlantizz'. Reason: city not found
AI:üß™ Sample Code Snippet with Error Handling:
python

import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"  # Replace this with your real API key
BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

def get_weather(city):
    params = {
        "q": city,
        "appid": API_KEY,
        "units": "metric"
    }
    
    response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        print(f"Weather in {city}: {data['weather'][0]['description'].capitalize()}")
        print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}¬∞C")
    else:
        print(f"‚ùå Error: Unable to fetch data for '{city}'. Reason: {response.json().get('message')}")

# Simulate error
get_weather("Atlantizz")

‚ùå Error: Unable to fetch data for 'Atlantizz'. Reason: city not found
üß† Explanation:
The API will return a 404 status code when the city is not found.

We extract the "message" field from the error response and show it to the user.

‚úÖ What You Learn from This:
How to handle API errors gracefully.

How to show clear feedback to the user instead of crashing.

How to debug when users give bad input (typos, etc.).

Would you like to:

Add this to your real project?

Try simulating a different type of error (like invalid API key)?

Learn how to create a ‚Äúretry‚Äù feature if the API fails?
