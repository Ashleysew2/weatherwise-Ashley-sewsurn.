me: Can I use natural language to ask about the weather instead of typing a city?
AI: Yes, you can absolutely use natural language to ask about the weather instead of directly typing a city—that’s one of the key goals of your assignment! The idea is to let the user ask questions like:

“What’s the weather in Melbourne tomorrow?”

“Will it rain in Sydney this weekend?”

“How hot will it be in Perth on Friday?”

To do that, you need to implement natural language processing (NLP) in your app. Specifically, your parse_weather_question(question) function will:

🧠 What You Need to Do
Take the user's natural language input

E.g., "Will it be sunny in Brisbane tomorrow?"

Parse it into structured data, like:

python
Copy
Edit
{
    "location": "Brisbane",
    "date": "tomorrow",
    "attribute": "sunny"  # or "condition"
}
Pass this structured data to your weather-fetching function (get_weather_data(location)), and then…

Generate a response using generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data), e.g.,

“Yes, it is expected to be sunny in Brisbane tomorrow with a high of 23°C.”

🧰 How to Parse Natural Language
You can use a simple rule-based method (good enough for this project) or a library like spaCy or dateparser.

Example using basic string parsing:

python
Copy
Edit
def parse_weather_question(question):
    question = question.lower()
    locations = ["melbourne", "sydney", "brisbane", "perth", "adelaide"]
    attributes = ["rain", "sunny", "temperature", "wind", "humidity"]
    dates = {
        "today": 0,
        "tomorrow": 1,
        "this weekend": 2  # you can interpret this however you like
    }

    location = next((loc for loc in locations if loc in question), None)
    attribute = next((attr for attr in attributes if attr in question), "condition")
    time_phrase = next((k for k in dates if k in question), "today")

    return {
        "location": location,
        "date": time_phrase,
        "attribute": attribute
    }
✅ Summary
You’re expected to allow natural-language queries as input. This is done by:

Capturing what the user types,

Parsing their question to extract: location, date/time, weather attribute,

Using those to fetch the right weather data,

And finally generating a human-readable answer.
