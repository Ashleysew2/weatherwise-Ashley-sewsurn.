# Assignment: WeatherWise â€“ Intelligent Weather Analysis & Advisory System

## Objective

Develop a Python-based interactive weather advisory system using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The system should:
- Retrieve weather forecasts for a given city.
- Visualize key weather parameters.
- Allow users to ask natural language questions and receive intelligent answers powered by AI.
- Be cleanly coded, modular, and documented.
- Be submitted as a GitHub repository with all required files.

## Key Features Required

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather forecasts (at least 3-5 days).
   - Handle API errors gracefully.

2. **Visualization**
   - Create charts showing temperature, humidity, etc., using matplotlib.

3. **Natural Language Interaction**
   - Allow users to ask questions about the forecast (e.g., "Will it rain this weekend?").
   - Provide intelligent responses based on the weather data.

4. **Coding Best Practices**
   - Use modular programming (separate functions).
   - Include meaningful comments and a clean structure.
   - Submit a clean `.ipynb` notebook.

5. **GitHub Repository Requirements**
   - `README.md`: Overview of the project and how to run it.
   - `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
   - `starter_notebook.ipynb`: Your final working notebook.
   - `ASSIGNMENT.md`: This file.
   - Optional: `ai-conversations/` folder to log prompt ideas or development conversations.

## Submission Instructions

- Submit your private GitHub repository link via the LMS.
- Ensure all required files are present.
- Test that the notebook renders and runs correctly on GitHub.
