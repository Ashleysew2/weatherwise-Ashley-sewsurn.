Assignment: WeatherWise - Intelligent Weather Analysis & Advisory System
Objective
Create an interactive advisory system in Python and integrate it with the OpenWeatherMap API. It should:

Fetch weather forecasts available for a particular city.

Visualize important weather parameters.

Enable users to ask questions and respond with AI-driven intelligent responses.

Be well structured, documented, and cleanly written.

Be submitted as a GitHub repository along with all relevant files.

Key Features Required
Data Retrieval
Retrieve the forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API for at least 3-5 days.

Implement handling of API errors.

Visualization
Use matplotlib to draw charts for temperature, humidity, etc.
Questions and Answers
Enable the user to inquire about the weather forecast (ex. Will it rain tomorrow?) and give them an intelligent answer considering the state of the weather.
Other Boundaries
Use separate functions for modular programming.

Write proper comments and a clean structure.

Submit a clean notebook (.ipynb).

GitHub Repository Requirements
Explain summarizing the project in README.md: including overview and how to run.

State the list of dependencies in Python in requirements.txt.

Your final working notebook in starter_notebook.ipynb

`ASSIGNMENT
This evaluation entailed creating WeatherWise: Intelligent Weather Analysis & Advisory System, a Python-based weather app that integrates real-time data retrieval with AI-powered user interaction. The project showcases my skills to:

Weather data may be retrieved and visualised using Python modules and APIs.

Create a user-friendly interface to explore predictions and conditions.

Allow natural language inquiry about the weather using conversational reasoning.

Collaborate successfully using AI tools to improve code and solve problems

Apply software development best practices, such as documentation and version control.

Through this project, I demonstrated not just my technical abilities, but also my ability to lead and harness AI help to create a practical and user-friendly weather adviser system.
